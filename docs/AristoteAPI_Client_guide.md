# Project actors, components and termminology

**Aristote** is an AI infrastructure which helps enrich pedagogical contents such as videos, providing automatic metadata and MCQ generation. It is made available through the use of the **AristoteAPI**.

An **AristoteAPI** `client` is a piece of software implemented in an edTech solution such as an on-demand video platform. The `client` implements the **AristoteAPI** in order to get enriched data from a source `Media`.

Posting a `Media` to the **AristoteAPI** creates an `Enrichment` object which will be processed by **Aristote's workers**.

The source `Media` is usually a video file (or most probably an URL to a video file), but other media will be supported in the future. The `Enrichment` of the `Media` made by the **Aristote's workers** consists of:
- generated metadata such as a title, a description text, tags, and classification into a list of media-types and disciplines whose possible values are given by the `client`.
- a transcription for Video and/or audio files
- an MCQ

The result of an `Enrichment` is called a `Version`, and the `Version`produced by the AI is called an `InitialVersion`.

`Enrichments` by AI are very usefull and time savers but are not perfect. It is important that the edTech product, in which the **AristoteAPI** `client` is integrated, implements a user interface to let the end user correct the generated output. In order to improve **Aristote AI**, it is also important the the corrected `Version` is posted by the `client`using the **AristoteAPI**


# Client API Charts

## Posting a `Media` and creating an `Enrichment`
The first step is to post a media to be processed by **Aristote**.

The *client* can post the URL of a video to create an `Enrichment`.
**Aristote** returns immediately an `Id` for this `Enrichment` and a status `WAITING_MEDIA_UPLOAD`.

**Aristote's workers** will then process the `Enrichment`:
- the **media worker** will download the media, and the `Enrichment` status will change to `UPLOADING_MEDIA` then `WAITING_MEDIA_TRANSCRIPTION`
- the **transcription worker** will process the video and the enrichment status will change to `TRANSCRBING_MEDIA` then to `WAITING_AI_ENRICHMENT`
- the **AI worker** will then process the `Enrichment` and its status will switch to `AI_ENRICHING` and then to `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`
- Failure can occur at several steps

Here is a basic state diagram of the statuses for the `Enrichment`:
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> UPLOADING_MEDIA
    UPLOADING_MEDIA --> WAITING_MEDIA_TRANSCRIPTION
    WAITING_MEDIA_TRANSCRIPTION --> TRANSCRBING_MEDIA    
    TRANSCRBING_MEDIA --> WAITING_AI_ENRICHMENT
    WAITING_AI_ENRICHMENT --> AI_ENRICHING
    AI_ENRICHING --> SUCCESS
    AI_ENRICHING --> FAILURE
    TRANSCRBING_MEDIA --> FAILURE
    UPLOADING_MEDIA --> FAILURE
    FAILURE --> [*]
    SUCCESS --> [*]
```

When the `Enrichment` has been processed, either successfully or with failure, an optional call to a *client* `Webhook` is made to notify the creation or failure of the `Enrichment`:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: POST /api/v1/enrichments/video-urls/upload
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status & enrichmentId
   AristoteAPI-->>-Client: optional feedback to WebHookURL (status,initialVersionId)
```

## Getting the status of `Enrichments`
At anytime a *client* can request the status of an `Enrichment` and **AristoteAPI** will answers if the *identity of the client* corresponds to the **owner** of the `EnrichmentId` provided:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: GET /api/v1/enrichments/{id}
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status (& initialVersionId when available)
```

At anytime a *client* can request the list of `Enrichments` and **AristoteAPI** will answers with the list of `Enrichments` **owned by** this particular `client`:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: GET /api/v1/enrichments/{id}
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status (& initialVersionId when available)
```

## Getting the content of an `Enrichment`'s `Version`
The result of an `Enrichment` is called a `Version`.
A successfully processed `Enrichment` containes an initial `Version` identified by and an `initialVersionId`.

The *client* can get the content of a `Version` by calling the `AristoteAPI`:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: GET /api/v1/versions/{versionId}
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status, transcript, metadata (title, description, tags, media-type), discipline, MCQ
```

## Managing multiple `Enrichment` `Versions`

The initial `Version` is the one produced by the AI, but the end user may want to correct the output. For instance fixing bad tags, fixing classification into media types or disciplines, or changing questions and/or answers of the MCQ.

The `client` must push the proposed corrections made by the end user un a new `Version` by using the  **AristoteAPI**:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: POST /api/v1/enrichments/{id}/versions
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status, new versionId
```

The `client` may get the list of `Versions` of a particular `Enrichment`:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: GET /api/v1/enrichments/{id}/versions
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status, list of Versions
```

The `client` may get the latest `Version` of a particular `Enrichment`:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: GET /api/v1/enrichments/{id}/versions/latest
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status, latest Version
```

The `client` **owning** an `Enrichment` may delete a `Version` if it's not the `InitialVersion`:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant AristoteAPI
   Client->>+AristoteAPI: DELETE /api/v1/versions/{versionId}
   AristoteAPI-->>Client: Status, latest Version
```
